The purpose of this project is to detail the software engineering documents as well as code for MedLife, (Patient Report Application), a seamless framework that allows users to have an organised system to maintain the medical history of the patient. This platform thus also serves as a system where patient can directly get his reports from labs and comments on his reports from his doctor without making several visits and appointments. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other external applications.

#Scope:
“Patient Report Application” is intended to be a cloud based and scalable free-to-use application that will be -
1. An easy to use framework, that allows the patient to maintain his entire medical history 
2. A common platform between Labs, Patients and Doctors to facilitate the exchange of test reports.
3. A messaging system between Doctors and Patients so that patient can use this portal ask relevant doubts to his doctor.
